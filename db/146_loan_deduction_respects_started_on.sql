-- The automatic take-off did not check a loan's own Since date, so a loan
-- entered with a start date still ahead of the current cutoff got taken off
-- anyway — five loans across three people were deducted before they were

-- date the shop agreed to start collecting; a cutoff paid before that date
-- has nothing to do with this loan yet.
